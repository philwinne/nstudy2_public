<div> SPInStudy is an online learning tool. It helps you organize information you study and manage that information. It also keeps track of your work.</span> 
<br>
<p>SPInStudy requires you to install an extension to your Chrome web browser. See the section &#34How do I access nStudy?&#34</p>
<br>
<span>In this description, we <i>italicize</i> terms of the vocabulary of SPInStudy and how it works.</span>
<br>
<p>SPInStudy has two different views: a &#34<i>Studying view</i>&#34 and a &#34<i>Library view</i> &#34</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Studying view, you can create objects such as <i>Highlights</i>, <i><i class="term" data-ot="A Note is where you can record general comments about information you are studying."> Notes </i></i> with different templates and <i><i class="term" data-ot="A Term is where you keep a description of a key concept"> Terms </i>.</i>
<br>
<br>
<li>Each object you create, stays attached to the location in which it was created</li>
<ol>
<p>This is how the <i>Studying view</i> will look in your Chrome browser: </p>
